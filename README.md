# Tech Blog

## Description

Tech is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in the world. From computers to phones to kitchen appliances, tech has shaped how we live and how we interact with one another. It's only natural that communities would build around such an integral part of our lives. Blogs have long existed as a way for users to interact with one another and connect over a shared interest. This application brings the user a site that will allow them to connect with other tech enthusiasts!

## Usage

Upon app launch, the user will arrive on the site's homepage, which displays all the posts currently on the blog. The user must log in to access any of the site's functionality. Clicking on any post or link will direct the user to the "login" page where they will be prompted to either log into an existing account or sign up for a new account.

Once the user has either signed in or created an account, they will be redirected to their dashboard; from their dashboard, the user may view all of their posts and create a new post. Clicking the "New post" button will redirect the user to a new page where they can create a new post which will be added to their dashboard and the homepage. Posts are displayed in the order they are posted to the site.

If the user clicks on a post (either on their dashboard or on the homepage), they will be redirected to a page displaying the post and all of its comments. From here, the user may choose to leave a comment on the post. If the post is one that belongs to the user, then the user may choose to edit or delete the post by clicking the trashcan or pencil icons respectively.
